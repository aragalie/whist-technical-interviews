## Overview

In this coding challenge, you will be debugging a simple UDP STUN server. A STUN server is a computer that is used to receive connection requests from devices behind NATs, and pair requests together so that two clients behind NATs can communicate together without needing decorated packets like HTTPS.

## Getting Started

Git clone this repository, and ```cd``` into the broken-stun folder. 

If you are running a Unix distribution (MacOS or Linux), you can compile the code by typing ```make```. If you are running Windows, we recommend you install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to compile the code. You do not need to compile the code in order to complete this assignment, although it may help you.

## Technical Details

You have 90 minutes to complete this assignment. The code in this folder has 5 known bugs in it. Start by opening up a stopwatch, notepad, and the code, and split screen all three of them (1/2 code, 1/4 stopwatch, 1/4 notepad). As you learn about how the codebase works, learn new things, and hopefully find bugs, write down your thoughts timestamped in the notepad. Just a sentence or two every few minutes, and definitely write about bugs as you find them (and potential fixes, if you can), or potential problems you see in the codebase. You're free to google as much as you want.

## How You Will Be Assessed

The timer is meant for us to understand context, you shouldn't be stressed by it, or feel that you need to find all the bugs within a specific timeframe.

You will be assessed on the quality and accuracy of your comments, and on the engineering style you demonstrate through them.

## Once You're Finished

Please DO NOT push to master; instead, branch your code changes and notes into a new branch via ```git branch [BRANCH NAME]``` and ```git checkout [BRANCH NAME]```, and submit your branch via ```git push origin [BRANCH NAME]```.

Have fun--we look forward to seeing your work!
