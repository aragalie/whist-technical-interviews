# Fractal Technical Interviews - Questions

DO NOT DISTRIBUTE

This repository contains the questions to the different technical interview questions that we administer or have administered in the past here at Fractal. Each folders contains one interview question, with its associated readme for directions and where the starter code contains blank statements where the candidate must provide work.

The associated interview solutions repository is at: https://github.com/fractalcomputers/interview-solutions

## Administering a Technical Interview

When administering a technical interview, please select the question you want from this repository, and add it to a brand new, private Fractal repo, and give access to the interviewe. Make sure to remove access at the end of the interview period, and to eventually delete the temporary repository once the interview decisions have been processed and released.

## Creating a Technical Interview Question

If you would like to create a technical interview question, you should feel free to do so. You can base yourself off of the existing questions to get an understanding of the structure. Once you have a question and you have developped a solution, you should make a pull request on the interview solutions repository so that 2 other Fractal engineers can attempt the question themselves and judge its difficulty. If it is deemed difficult enough to assess strong technical candidates, the solution can added here as a subfolder and the question can be added to this repository.
