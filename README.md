# Fractal Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Overview

In this coding challenge, you will be creating a simple grocery-list web app called Shopper. With Shopper, users can manually enter and store the grocery items that they want to purchase, label grocery items (e.g. "bought"), or delete items from their grocery list.

## Getting Started


## Technical Details

You will have three hours to build the grocery-list app. A demo of all the minimum features we would expect this app to have is here: DEMO HERE.

These features are:

1. Ability to manually enter grocery items. We don't require that you do spell-checking here.
2. Ability to view all your stored grocery items.
3. Ability to apply labels to grocery items. In the demo, we can mark grocery items as "bought" or "not available."
4. Ability to delete grocery items from the list.

## How You Will Be Assessed

Your solution will be assessed using three main criteria: functionality, design, and user experience. 

1. Functionality measures how well your code works--are all the features implemented, and are there any obvious bugs? 
2. Design measures how aesthetically pleasing your final product is. You may have noticed that the above demo looked pretty horrible; this is done intentionally, so as to not influence your design decisions. Since this is a timed challenge, we don't expect the final product to look like the Stripe dashboard, but we are looking to develop a sense of what your design + overall CSS abilities might be (although we understand that good designs are difficult to implement under time pressure).
3. User experience measures how easy it is to use the website. Responsive components (i.e. components that react to user behavior, for instance, notifications that something has been done successfully) are heavily encouraged.

Have fun--we look forward to seeing your work!
