## Administering a Technical Interview

When administering a technical interview, please select the [`interview-questions`](https://github.com/fractal/interview-questions) repository, add it to a brand new, private Fractal repository, and give access to the candidate. Make sure to remove access at the end of the interview period, and to delete the temporary repository once the interview notes have been collected and compiled. You should collect interview notes in the Notion, under the [Resumes & Interviews](https://www.notion.so/tryfractal/8f16952aecf542d1b6ed2f8a0bdcd26b?v=40797fca108c4304a47b21c8939acfc5) workspace.

## Creating a Technical Interview Question

If you would like to create a technical interview question, you should feel free to do so. You can base it off of the existing questions to get an understanding of the structure. Once you have a question and you have developped a solution, you should make a pull request on this repository so that 2 other Fractal engineers can attempt the question themselves and judge its difficulty. If it is deemed difficult-enough to assess strong technical candidates, the solution can be added here as a subfolder and the question can be added to the [`interview-questions`](https://github.com/fractal/interview-questions) repository.
